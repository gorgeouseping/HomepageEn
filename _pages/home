Open Source Dataset Product:
======
DBNet (LiDAR-Video Driving Dataset: Learning Driving Policies Effectively) is a large-scale dataset product containing 3D point clouds, video images, GNSS, and driver behavior (speed and direction). It covers various road types in Xiamen City, totaling over 1000 kilometers. The 3D spatial point cloud and 2D video image data at the city level can provide a basis for autonomous driving decision-making. It has been downloaded and used globally by over 600 units and individuals, including MIT, Google, etc. Feel free to download and use.
